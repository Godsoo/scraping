            "full_text": "It's the Death Star.  It's Lego.  It's Epic.\nWords cannot describe the building experience of this Lego set - it's a huge project, between my 8 year old son and myself, we took around 20 hours.  The way it forms out of the many thousands of pieces is wonderful, going from structure sections into highly detailed rooms, then back into more structure.  Lego have provided an amazing manual to help you with the journey - it's a masterpiece of clear pictures, plus the many bags and boxes are clearly labelled.The completed set is so full of detail you can get quite lost in it, the opportunities for play are endless with all the best scenes from New Hope and Return of the Jedi included.  The huge amount of minifigures that come with it add to the play experience.  You will not be disappointed with the end result - lasers move, doors can be opened, lifts go up and down, walls close in....on and on.The very best part of this, is it's a still a TOY, it's not a collectors model to just be looked at, you can get your hands dirty with this one.So are there any bad points?  Well, it's expensive but, in my opinion, worth the cost.  Some of the parts are a little fragile and I have to confess to gluing a few bits - the dish of the superlaser, the base that the turbo laser sits on and the tractor beam power station.I guess the last point to consider is you need to know where you are going to put it before you buy it - it's huge and not easily ported around although it's strong and the overall structure is not going to fall apart.Oh, and people will hate you for having it!"

            "full_text": "The one, the only... LEGO!\nAnother excellent LEGO pack, when I was 5 years old my Dad bought me STAR WARS IV A NEW HOPE, that was the first time I ever witnessed the detail and mass scale of the Death Star. I always wanted to search through the corridors surrounded by Stormtroopers of the Death Star and find unseen rooms, as a 5 year old it amazed me. The LEGO Death Star certainly lets you explore, with very well known rooms such as the garbage compactor to a Stormtrooper dressing room. May I just tell you there are over 10 rooms as well including the Emperor's evil lair in which the legendary duel of Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker took place on Episode VI. The set includes 25 mini figures! Including Luke Skywalker in Stormtrooper version, Han Solo in Stormtrooper version, Chewbacca, Princess Leia, R2D2, C3P0, Ben Kenobi, Luke Skywalker in Tatooine farm boy version, Han Solo in Mos Eisley Spaceport version, Luke Skywalker with green bladed lightsabre, the trash monster, two Death Star troopers, two Stormtroopers, Darth Vader. ( Breath ) Grand Moff Tarkin, The Emperor, two Royal Guards, a droid, black C3P0, R2D5, a Pk droid and IG88. It is a spectacular pack. The one, the only...LEGO!"

            "full_text": "Quite simply - brilliant\nMy lucky, lucky children won this Lego set in a draw.  I don't think that they quite realise how lucky they are, as there is very little chance that Daddy would spend three hundred quid on Lego, even for something as impressive as this.And it is impressive.  We are about 2/3 through building it, and the detailing is superb, better than I expected.  As a boy who saw Star Wars when I was about 7 (same age as my son is now), I never could have dreamt that I would have a toy like this.  As an adult, I can see how well the model is put together, how much thought has gone into the plans/instructions so that you build it in sections.  There is a lot to admire in the construction - it holds together well, particularly given how heavy it is - like another reviewer, I think this model is good for a few lessons in structural engineering...But that isn't why I like it.  I like it because it's the Death Star, in Lego, with a mini-figure of Emperor Palpatine (complete with Sith lightning) sitting on a throne while Luke and Darth Vadar thrash it out below.  It's Luke, Leia and Han Solo in the garbage crusher, with a many-tentacled monster - in a garbage crusher that I made, that I can see how it operates.  Brilliant."

            "full_text": "Way overpriced\nYes, it's the Death Star.Yes, it has a ridiculous amount of minifigures.Yes, it's sizeable.Yes, it's a good build and looks epic.However, the prices that it's being sold for on here are RIDICULOUS. Some \u00a360 more expensive than the RRP (which I notice, is handily not mentioned anywhere). It's way cheaper on the official Lego site, so go there to make your purchase."

            "full_text": "A great gift - a real Death Star!\nMy wife bought this for myself and my 25 year old daughter (a si-fi geek!) last Xmas.  Took around 20 hours to build over the next 3 days!  Is now shared between our 2 homes so travels easily!  We have friends whose 6 year old son is in awe that we have a real Death Star that he can really play with.It is a joy to build and to watch others playing with it. Yes its only lego and yes its expensive but compared to what you can waste money on this is just something very special.The instructions are details and you need to follow hard to ensure you get it right but its a great fun challenge.  Anyone want to buy a ready made Death Star....lol"

            "full_text": "This battle station is fully operational!\nThe best Lego Star Wars set as far as I am concerned. Had the cardboard Pailtoy Death Star Set as a boy and it never really satisfied. This has everything.  The major locations from Episode IV and VI,  all the main characters, a tie fighter and most importantly a Dia-noga!A word of warning do not buy from Amazon at this price.  Cost from Lego shop is \u00a3275.  Don't delay as this set will go out of production this year!Received set on Saturday and I am not even half way through building it (7 1/2 hrs and counting already). Its Big!Well back to building!"

            "full_text": "It's NOT a moon\nPlease be aware that this is the Death Star 1.0 so it represents the fully functional space station (which, is sometimes mistaken for a small moon). If you wish to model DS 2.0, you just need to leave some parts off this version and be sure to set a trap.It is extremely important that any potential buyers shut down the auxiliary power on their credit cards because the tractor beam is rather powerful. But there are alternatives to buying"

So, although it took him a long time to complete it, with just a little help from Dad - the instruction manual is about half an inch thick - the methods were clear and easy to follow. What a way to keep an energetic lad quiet!"
